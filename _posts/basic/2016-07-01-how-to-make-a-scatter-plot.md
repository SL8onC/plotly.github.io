steps:
 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Scatter plots show the relationship between two variables."
    - copy: "Before getting started with your own dataset, you can check out an example. First, select the 'Type' menu. Hovering the mouse over the chart type icon, will display three options: 1) Charts like this by Plotly users, 2) View tutorials on this chart type and 3) See a basic example."
    - copy: "Clicking the 'See a basic example' option will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what labels and style attributes were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."
      img: "![Example after](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-try-example.gif)"
    - copy: "You can also use the data featured in this tutorial by clicking on 'Open This Data in Plotly' on the left-hand side. It'll open in your workspace."

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotlyâ€™s [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

 - title: Create a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding data, go to 'Structure' on the left-hand side, then 'Traces'. Choose 'Scatter' under 'Simple' chart type."
      img: "![Choose chart main](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-choose-chart.png)"
    - copy: "Next, select 'X' and 'Y' values from the dropdown menus. This will create a raw scatter trace, as seen below."

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "You can choose your colors, text position, or typeface. Click on the 'Style' menu on the left-hand side to play around with the style of your plot."
    - copy: "To change the colors, go to the 'Traces' section under the 'Style' menu."
      img: "![Colour main](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-colour-panel.gif)"
    - copy: "To set the plot title, go to the 'General' section under the 'Style' menu and type in the plot title within the textbox provided under 'Title'."
      img: "![Plot Title](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-title.png)"
    - copy: "Another approach is to click and then enter the title directly on the plot interface. The same can be done for the axes title and the legends."
      img: "![Type directly title](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-title-direct.gif)"

 - title: Save and Share
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "To save the plot click 'Save' button on the left-hand side. A Save pop-up will appear, as seen below, where you can specify the filename for your plot and data."
      img: "![Save main](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-save-main.png)"
    - copy: "Select the privacy setting for the plot and data as 'Public' or 'Private' or 'Private link'. For more information on how sharing works, including the difference between private, public, and secret sharing, visit [this](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) page.."
