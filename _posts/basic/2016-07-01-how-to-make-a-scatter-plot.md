Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what labels and style attributes were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."

    - copy: "For plots that have a larger data set with more values, you may want to display each group in different colors. This option is not currently available, but is coming soon!"
    - copy: "To add a title to your plot, you can type it directly on the title by double-clicking it."
      img: "![Type directly title](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-type-title-directly.png)"
    - copy: "The same can be done for the axis labels, and legend."
