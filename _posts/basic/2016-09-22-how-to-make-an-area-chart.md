    - copy: "With this type of chart, the area between the x-axis and lines are commonly emphasized with colors, shading, and/or textures."
    - copy: "You can use the data featured in this tutorial by clicking on 'Open This Data in Plotly' on the left-hand side. It'll open in your workspace."

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotly’s new online [workspace](https://plot.ly/create) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

    - copy: "After adding your own data, choose your 'Chart Type' in the GRAPH section on the left-hand side and select 'Area Chart'."
    - copy: "Click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your axes to your plot. Select 'Area chart' then fill out the X and Y dropdown menus to create the plot."

      img: "![Raw plot](../static/images/area-charts-in-excel-with-plotly/raw area chart.png)"
    - copy: "For charts that have many values such as this one, we need to add more data to the plot. We do this by clicking on the '+Trace' button at the top right-hand side of that pane."
      img: "![Trace open](../static/images/area-charts-in-excel-with-plotly/add traces area.png)"
    - copy: "You can add as many traces as you need, until your plot is complete!"
      img: "![All traces](../static/images/area-charts-in-excel-with-plotly/all traces area.png)"

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Now it's time to choose the color, text position or typeface. Click on STYLE on the left-hand side to play around with the style of your plot."
    - copy: "To change the fill color, click on ‘Traces’ under the same STYLE tab, and choose the color you want. Note that certain colors and typeface are only available with a PRO subscription. Click [here](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/) to upgrade!"
      img: "![Colour main](../static/images/area-charts-in-excel-with-plotly/colour tab area.png)"
    - copy: "Not only can you play with the color, but you can also add points to your lines and color those as well. You can change the diameter of the point, and if the dot doesn't do it for you, you can choose another symbol. You also have the option of selecting the type and shape of line and adjusting its thickness. "

    - copy: "The same can be done for the axis labels and legend."
