otherlang: Know how to program? Learn about [collaborating with our APIs](https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/collaboration/), including Python, R, and Matlab.

steps: 
 - title: Introduction
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Whether you're using Plotly to create graphs for school, business, or for fun, you can [share and export](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) these graphs so your colleagues and friends can see your work. Additionally, you can add collaborators to your charts."
    - copy: "What's the difference between sharing and collaborating?"
    - copy: "Sharing is a way for people to view your plot, and you can do so publicly or with a secret link. For more information about sharing, click [here](http://help.plot.ly/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/). Collaborating is not only sharing your plot, you're giving your fellow collaborator the permission to edit them as well. It's a way for more than one user to work on the same plot."
    - copy: "Collaborators can be anyone; your co-worker or classmate, and they can edit your plot as well as your data. Please not that the collaborators also need to [sign up](http://help.plot.ly/how-to-sign-up-to-plotly/) to Plotly if they don't already have an account."

 - title: Add Collaborators to a Plot
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After you've [plotted](http://help.plot.ly/tutorials/#basic), [styled](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) and [saved](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) your graph, you can start adding collaborators."
    - copy: "Click on 'Share' button on the left-hand side of the [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create). When the 'Share' modal appears, click on the 'Collaborate' tab at the top. Enter the Plotly username or email address of the collaborators, and you can add a message if you wish. You can also add more than one collaborator, as seen below."
      img: "![Invite people](../static/images/collaboration-doc/add-collaborators.png)"
    - copy: "In addition, the collaborators can [edit](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/#step-5-update-your-data) the grid/data associated with the plot. The 'Add Collaborators to Grids' option is set to default. You can restrict them from editing the grid by checking off that option, as seen below." 
    - copy: "Also, if the 'Send Notification Email' option is checked, an email will be sent to the collaborator's email address (associated with their plotly account). Please note if the collaborator has no plotly account, a [sign-up](https://plot.ly/accounts/login/?action=signup) link will be sent within the email after which they can view and edit the plot."
      img: "![Disable grid](../static/images/collaboration-doc/disable-grid-collaboration.png)"
    - copy: "Once you've clicked 'Add', their username or email address will appear under 'Current Collaborators'."

 - title: Add Collaborators to a Grid
   sub-steps:   
    - copy: "In order for them to edit any element of the plot, you must add the collaborator on both the plot and the associated data grid. Even if they're only styling the chart and not editing the data, they must be added as collaborators to your grid. If you add them to your plot only, the plot gets copied for the collaborator and is saved as a copied plot." 
    - copy: "To add collaborators to your grid, go to your [list of files](https://plot.ly/organize/home). Hover over your grid thumbnail, then click on the 'Share' icon."
      img: "![Organize page](../static/images/collaboration-doc/organize page.png)"
    - copy: "Once the pop-up appears, add their username or email address and click ADD."

 - title: Remove Collaborators 
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "If you want to remove your collaborators, click on the 'x' next to their name. When you hover over the 'x', you'll see a little pop-up telling you to click to remove that user from being a collaborator."
      img: "![Remove Collaborator](../static/images/collaboration-doc/remove-collaborator.png)"

 - title: As a Collaborator
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Time to switch places! Let's look at it from the collaborator's side."
    - copy: "If the creator of the plot has opted to notify you by via email, you'll receive one, stating that they want to share a plot with you and wish to collaborate. You'll be given a link of where you can view the plot (called the 'Shareplot' page). You can click on 'Fork & Edit' to edit the plot."
      img: "![Fork and edit](../static/images/collaboration-doc/fork and edit.png)"
    - copy: "Otherwise, shared plots and grids can be viewed in the same ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page, then by clicking on 'Shared with me' on the left-hand side."
      img: "![Shared Files](../static/images/collaboration-doc/sharewithme.png)"
    - copy: "The plot and/or grid will be listed as thumbnails, and you'll have to hover over one and click on EDIT IN 2.0."
      img: "![Hover thumbnail](../static/images/collaboration-doc/hover-thumbnail.png)"
    - copy: "You'll be taken to the [workspace](https://plot.ly/create) and as you can see, it looks exactly like it did when it was saved and shared. Now it's your turn to work on it!"
      img: "![Hover thumbnail](../static/images/collaboration-doc/collab on workspace.png)"
    - copy: "Looks like you've [added another trace](http://help.plot.ly/make-a-line-graph-or-scatter-plot/#step-3-create-a-chart) and [styled](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) the graph. It looks pretty cool!"
      img: "![New plot](../static/images/collaboration-doc/new plot.png)"
    - copy: "Now you're now ready to save. There's no need to rename the file."
      img: "![Save new plot](../static/images/collaboration-doc/save new plot.png)"
    - copy: "The creator of the plot will go back to their [list of files](https://plot.ly/organize/home) and see that the plot was updated."
      img: "![New plot](../static/images/collaboration-doc/after collab.png)"   
      
 - title: Helpful Reminders
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "If you have a PRO account and have created a chart, or used features that are only available with a PRO subscription, but are collaborating with someone who has a Community account, they won't be able to save the plot."
    - copy: "Under any sharing scenario, the collaborator cannot change the plot or grids names, or add new grids."
    - copy: "You can save your plots as private or public. If you set your plot as private, no one will be able to view it, only your collaborators will be able to view and edit your plot."
    - copy: "For an easier way to keep your files organized, and to keep track of your plots and their associated grids, we highly recommend that you name your plot and grid when you [save them](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/)."
