otherlang: Know how to program? Learn about [collaborating with our APIs](https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/collaboration/), including Python, R, and Matlab.

steps: 
 - title: Introduction
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Whether you're using Plotly to create graphs for school, business, or for fun, you can [share and export](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) these graphs so your colleagues and friends can see your work. Additionally, you can add collaborators to your charts."
    - copy: "What's the difference between sharing and collaborating?"
    - copy: "Sharing is a way for people to view your plot, and you can do so publicly or with a secret link. For more information about sharing, click [here](http://help.plot.ly/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/). Collaborating is not only sharing your plot, you're giving your fellow collaborator the permission to edit them as well. It's a way for more than one user to work on the same plot."
    - copy: "Collaborators can be anyone; your co-worker or classmate, and they can edit your plot as well as your data. Please not that the collaborators also need to [sign up](http://help.plot.ly/how-to-sign-up-to-plotly/) to Plotly if they don't already have an account."

 - title: Add Collaborators to a Plot
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After you've [plotted](http://help.plot.ly/tutorials/#basic), [styled](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) and [saved](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) your graph, you can start adding collaborators."
    - copy: "Click on 'Share' button on the left-hand side of the [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create). When the 'Share' modal appears, click on the 'Collaborate' tab at the top. Enter the Plotly username or email address of the collaborators, and you can add a message if you wish. You can also add more than one collaborator, as seen below."
      img: "![Invite people](../static/images/collaboration-doc/add-collaborators.png)"
    - copy: "In addition, the collaborators can [edit](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/#step-5-update-your-data) the grid (data) associated with the plot. By default, the option 'Add Collaborators to Grids' is checked on. You can checking off this option while adding collaborators, to restrict them from editing the grid, please note that the collaborators can still be able to change the [style] (http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) of you chart"
    - copy: "Also, if the 'Send Notification Email' option is checked, an email will be sent to the collaborator's email address (associated with their plotly account). Please note if the collaborator does not have a plotly account, a [sign-up](https://plot.ly/accounts/login/?action=signup) link will be sent within the email, after signing-up they can view and edit the plot."
      img: "![Disable grid](../static/images/collaboration-doc/disable-grid-collaboration.png)"
    - copy: "Once you've clicked 'Add', the collaborator's username or email address will appear under the 'Current Collaborators' field."
      img: "![Current collaborators](../static/images/collaboration-doc/current-collaborators.png)"
    - copy: "Another approach to add collaborators is by navigating to the ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page where the plots and data are stored, and hover over the plot or grid thumbnail and then click the 'Share' icon."
      img: "![Share from Organize page](../static/images/collaboration-doc/share-from-files.png)"
    - copy: "To add collaborators only to the grid (data) associated to a plot but not the plot itself, then click 'Share' icon after hovering over the grid's thumbnail. The 'Share' modal will then look like:"
      img: "![Grid Collaboration](../static/images/collaboration-doc/grid-collaboration.png)"

 - title: Remove Collaborators 
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "If you want to remove your collaborators, click on the 'x' next to their name. When you hover over the 'x', you'll see a little pop-up telling you to click to remove that user from being a collaborator."
      img: "![Remove Collaborator](../static/images/collaboration-doc/remove-collaborator.png)"

 - title: As a Collaborator
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "If the owner of the plot has opted to notify you by via email, you'll receive one, stating that they want to share a plot with you and wish to collaborate. You'll be given a link of where you can view the plot. You can then click on 'Edit' icon on the top right corner to edit the plot."
      img: "![Edit](../static/images/collaboration-doc/collaborator-edit.png)"
    - copy: "Otherwise, all shared plots and grids can be viewed in the ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page, by clicking on the 'Shared with me' tab in the left-hand side, as seen below."
      img: "![Shared Files](../static/images/collaboration-doc/share-with-me.png)"
    - copy: "Then, the plot or grid can be viewed or edited by clicking on 'View' or 'Edit' button that appears when hovering over the thumbnail."
      img: "![Hover thumbnail](../static/images/collaboration-doc/hover-thumbnail.gif)"
    - copy: "You'll be taken to the [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create) and as you can see, it looks exactly like it did when it was saved and shared by the plot owner. Now it's your turn to work on it!"
      img: "![Hover thumbnail](../static/images/collaboration-doc/collaborator-chart-studio.png)"
    - copy: "After making the necessary changes, save the plot and data by clicking on the 'Save' button in the left-hand side. Please note that saving the plot and data will only save the changes and update the actual files shared by the owner."
    - copy: "The owner of the plot will then go back to their ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page and see the updated plot and data."
      
 - title: Helpful Reminders
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "When a plot or data is saved after making any changes by the collaborator, it will not create local copies of the plot and grid, rather updates the actual files shared by the owner of the plot."
    - copy: "When a plot, but not it's grid is shared with the collaborator, a modal will pop up telling the collaborator that they don't have access to change the grid, as seen below."
      img: "![No Grid](../static/images/collaboration-doc/collaborator-grid-restriction.png)"
    - copy: "Under any sharing scenario, the collaborator cannot change the plot or grids names, or add new grids to the plot." 
    - copy: "If the owner of the plot has opted to save the plot or grid as private, no one will be able to view them, only the collaborators will be able to view or edit them."
    - copy: "Under any circumstances, the collaborator cannot change the privacy settings associated with the plot or grid, or share the files."
      img: "![No Share](../static/images/collaboration-doc/collaborator-no-share.gif)"
    - copy: "For an easier way to keep your files organized, and to keep track of the plots and their associated grids, we highly recommend to save them with proper filenames."
